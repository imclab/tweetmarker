`GET /v2/lastread?api_key=yourkey&username=manton&collection=timeline&collection=mentions`

	{
		"timeline":  {
			"id": 123456,
			"updated_at": "Sun Mar 25 16:32:54 +0000 2012",
			"marked_at": "Sun Mar 25 16:32:54 +0000 2012",
			"version": 15
		},
		"mentions":  {
			"id": 123456,
			"updated_at": "Sun Mar 25 16:32:54 +0000 2012",
			"marked_at": "Sun Mar 25 16:32:54 +0000 2012",
			"version": 42
		}
	}

`POST /v2/lastread?api_key=yourkey&username=manton`

	{
		"timeline":  {
			"id": 123456,
			"marked_at": "Sun Mar 25 16:32:54 +0000 2012",
		},
		"mentions":  {
			"id": 123456,
			"marked_at": "Sun Mar 25 16:32:54 +0000 2012",
		}
	}

For the POST, only the "id" value (tweet status ID) and one or more collection keys is required. The "marked\_at" is a new timestamp which can be set by the client and will be preserved on the server and returned in the GET. It's optional, and there's also an "updated\_at" that is the timestamp of when the record was actually saved. Usually these will be within a second or so, depending on how long the request is. If a client does not include a "marked\_at" value, then the server will automatically set it to match "updated\_at".

The simplest POST with only required values:

`POST /v2/lastread?api_key=yourkey&username=manton`

	{
		"timeline":  {
			"id": 123456
		}
	}

The "version" field is incremented on the server every time the record is saved. You can use this (or the timestamps) to determine if the record has been changed by another client. If before sending to the server the version was "2", then you can expect it will be "3" the next time if no other client has updated the value in the meantime. If any other client has changed it, it will be "4" or greater.

If you want to request more than one collection in a single GET request, include multiple "collection" params as in the example above. No collection name is used from the URL in a POST since it's now in the JSON body as hash keys.

The 4 possible values for each collection for completeness (same as first example above):

id: read/write (required)  
marked\_at: read/write (optional)  
updated\_at: read-only  
version: read-only
